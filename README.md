# QR Code Component – Frontend Mentor Challenge

This is my solution to the Frontend Mentor – QR Code Component challenge. The goal of this challenge is to build a simple, responsive card component containing a QR code and descriptive text.

# Overview


Users should be able to:

1. View the component at a responsive size on any device.

2. See a clean, centered QR code card with proper spacing and typography.
